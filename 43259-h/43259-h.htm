<h2>
Preface
</h2>


<p>
This little book will interest the Pittsburgher of 1916 chiefly
because the parts and pieces of which it is made were written by men
who were living here or who passed this way in 1816.
</p>

<p>
The three newspapers of the day&#8212;the Gazette, the Mercury, and the
Commonwealth&#8212;have furnished, though somewhat sparingly, the items of
local news. They have also furnished advertisements&#8212;these in greater
abundance and variety.
</p>

<p>
The men who were the tourists of the day in America, traveling by
stage, wagon, boat, or on horseback, often made Pittsburgh a stopping
place in their journey. Many of them wrote books, in which may be
found two or three pages, or a chapter, on the city as it appeared at
that time. It is from these books that the section "Impressions of
early travelers" has been gathered. The date given with these extracts
is the date of publication, but the period referred to in every case
is between 1815 and 1817.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these gleanings from contemporaries, a number of
paragraphs from various histories of the city have been included.
</p>

<p>
The sketches that have thus been bought together do not form a
systematic or well proportioned description of the city; yet they may
help, through their vivid pictures and first-hand impressions, to give
some idea of life in Pittsburgh a century ago.

A MEETING<br>
OF THE<br>
DEMOCRATICK REPUBLICANS<br>
OF THE<br>
CITY OF PITTSBURGH,
</p>

<p>
will be held at the house of Captain Jacob Carmack, (sign of the
<i>Turk's Head</i>, Wood-street,) this <i>evening</i> (Tuesday June
25,) at 7 o'clock for the purpose of forming a <i>ticket</i> for the
select and common Councils of the City of Pittsburgh.

City Election
</p>

<p>
A number of respectable citizens, desirous of preserving that harmony
which has for several years past, so happily prevailed in the borough
councils, and which is so essential to the prosperity of our infant
city, have formed the following Ticket. They recommend it to the cool,
dispassionate considerations of their fellow citizens; and they
flatter themselves, that it will, on the day of the election, meet
with a firm and honorable support. It is formed, as tickets of the
kind ought to be, without respect to party. There can exist no
possible ground for the absurdity, that party feuds and animosity
should be called up on occasions like the present. Every consideration
of public interest, and of the peace and good order of the city,
forbids it.&#8212;Our city is as yet in its infancy.&#8212;Its government is to
be organized, its ordinances framed, its police established, and its
general policy devised.
</p>

<p>
In accomplishing these important objects, great prudence,
deliberation, forbearance, and the <i>undivided support of all classes
of the citizens</i>, are essentially necessary. Hence arises the
necessity of checking, in the bud, any and every attempt, coming from
whatever quarter it may, which would have a tendency to sow disunion
and distrust among the people. Actuated by these reasons, the
following ticket is recommended to the free and independent voters.
Their aid and co-operation is solicited in checking the evils which
may arise out of party feuds. The gentlemen composing the ticket here
recommended, have been chosen with due regard to their local
situations; they are respectable in private life; they are well
qualified for discharging the duties which will devolve upon them as
members of the councils, and are all deeply interested in the growth,
prosperity, and good order of the infant city.

"Voters supported or opposed a candidate entirely according to their
personal preferences. There were few newspapers and no political
oratory to sway public sentiment. The United States was then passing
through the 'era of good feeling,' which was renowned mainly for the
absence of all political asperities. Had any question arisen which was
fraught with political significance to the voters of this section the
expression in and around Pittsburg would undoubtedly have been
Democratic or in opposition to the Federalist doctrine. It took
Pittsburg people a long time to forget that the excise tax, which
brought about the Whiskey Insurrection, was a Federalist measure. The
first question which arose to divide the people in bitter dispute came
with the election of Andrew Jackson to the presidency in 1828."

The New Mayor
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
Ebenezer Denny, esq. has been elected mayor of the city of Pittsburgh,
<i>Ohio</i>.&#8212;This gentleman we believe is from Massachusetts and
is highly respected for his integrity and patriotism. <cite>Boston
Yankee.</cite>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We congratulate the editor of the Yankee upon the knowledge of men and
places, exhibited in the foregoing article. It has been a custom at
the Eastward to censure and burlesque the people of Western
Pennsylvania on account of their ignorance. Let the editor of the
Yankee now blush at his own. Could it be believed that any man of
common geographical knowledge&#8212;or who could have referred to Dr. Morse
for information, (for on this subject <i>even Dr. Morse</i> is
correct) would have located Pittsburgh&#8212;a city containing ten thousand
inhabitants&#8212;possessing a manufacturing capital of many
millions&#8212;having three banking institutions, and a commerce extending
to every part of the union&#8212;a place which has long been considered the
emporium of the West, and which makes a more conspicuous figure in
books of travels than even the Town of Notions itself;&#8212;could it, we
ask, be believed, that such a place should be so little known or
thought of in the town of Boston, as to be located in the state of
Ohio? Mayor Denny possesses all the virtues that are attributed to him
by the Yankee, and many more, that render him an ornament to the
station to which he has been elected;&#8212;but he does not boast an
ancestry in the land of <i>steady habits</i>, the seat of <i>Hartford
Convention politics</i>. He is a native of Carlisle, in this state.

"A mixture of all nations, though principally Americans; there are
Irish, Scotch, English, French, Dutch, Swiss, etc&#8230;. The character of
the people is that of enterprising and persevering industry; every man
to his business is the prevailing maxim, there is therefore little
time devoted to amusements or to the cultivation of refined social
pleasures. Strangers are not much pleased with the place in point of
hospitality merely, but those who have business to transact, will meet
with as many facilities as elsewhere. They are of all denominations of
the Christian religion; many of them attentive on the duties of their
worship, and but few addicted to gross vices and dissipation. Luxury,
pomp and parade are scarcely seen; there are perhaps, not more than
one or two carriages in the place. There is a public academy, but not
in a flourishing state, where the Latin and Greek classics are taught.
There are besides, a number of English schools where children are
taught to read, write, arithmetic, grammar, etc. There is a seminary
for young ladies, which is said to be well conducted. The amusements
of these industrious people are not numerous, a few balls during the
winter season; there is also a small theatre where a company from the
eastern cities sometimes performs. A society has been formed for the
purpose of natural improvement in the different departments of natural
history, and is flourishing; it has attached to it a circulating
library, a cabinet of curiosities and chemical laboratory."

"The first buildings of Pittsburg were of logs, some of which were
unhewn; then came rude stone structures made from material quarried
nearby, and these in turn were followed by brick buildings, for with
an abundance of clay and fuel, it was an easy matter to burn brick. In
none of them was there any attempt at architectural beauty. Most of
them consisted of four square walls, with small windows and doors,
thus displaying every evidence of economy. The interior finish of the
early houses displayed more taste and beauty than the exterior, for it
was easier to carve and fashion in wood than in stone&#8230;. Nevertheless
there was a beauty in the simplicity of the walls that gradually
developed a style which in modern days is called Colonial
architecture, and which even yet predominates in Pittsburg."

"Pittsburg is a considerable town, generally built of brick&#8230;. The
site is romantic and delightful. It is well known as a manufacturing
place, and once almost supplied the lower country with a variety of
the most necessary and important manufactures. But the wealth,
business, and glory of this place are fast passing away, transferred
to Cincinnati, to Louisville, and other places on the Ohio. Various
causes have concurred to this result; but especially the
multiplication of steam-boats, and the consequent facility of
communication with the Atlantic ports by the Mississippi. There is
little prospect of the reverse of this order of things. The national

foot-walks on each side. Watch-boxes are placed at convenient

burning coal, the buildings have not that clean appearance so

this place several days, during which time the rain never ceased. The

Pittsburgh is laid out to front both rivers; but as these do not

It is not a well built city. The south-west part is the most compact,

"In October, 1816, a resolution was passed permitting a Mr. Gray to
exhibit a panoramic view of the naval engagement on Lake Champlain and
the battle of Plattsburg without a license or other tax, owing to 'the
patriotic nature and worthy object of the exhibit.' In November, 1816,
a committee was appointed to inquire whether it was expedient for the
city to possess for public purposes more ground than it then did, and
whether it would be expedient at that time to purchase ground upon
which to erect buildings. In December a resolution introduced by Mr.
Wilkins provided for the appointment of a special committee to make a
detailed report upon the condition of the manufactures of Pittsburg,
which resolution was adopted; whereupon the following committee was
appointed: Benjamin Bakewell, Aquila M. Bolton and James Arthurs&#8230;.
The city councils at this time also sent agents to Harrisburg and

"The price of property has increased in the most surprising manner
within the last ten years; it is now at least ten times as high as it
was at that period. There are but few sales of lots in fee simple, the
custom is to let on perpetual lease; the price in Market and Wood
streets, varies from ten to twenty dollars per foot, and in the other
streets from four to eight, and in particular situations still higher.
The rents are equally high. In Market, Wood and Water streets, the
principal places of business, it is difficult to procure a common room
in an upper story, under one hundred dollars per annum; the rent of
stores, vary from three to five hundred dollars; there is one
warehouse which rents for twelve hundred; the rent of tavern stands,
is from five to twelve hundred dollars. The rent of dwelling houses
varies much, according to the locality and kind of the tenement; a
genteel private family can scarcely obtain a good dwelling under three
or four hundred dollars." <cite>Cramer's Navigator, 1817.</cite>

"Provisions of all kinds bring a high price in this city though the

and oats one dollar per bushel. Butter varies from twenty-five to
seventy-five cents per pound. The farmers of this neighbourhood,
however, produce neither cheese or pork, that merits a notice. The
former of these articles is chiefly obtained from the state of Ohio,
and bacon, procured from Kentucky, is now retailed at sixteen or
seventeen cents per pound.
</p>

<p>
Before the late war, this market was distinguished for its cheapness;
but with an influx of strangers, induced by the movements of that
period, '<i>war prices</i>' commenced; and though peace has
returned&#8212;and though many of those new comers have sought their former
places of residence,&#8212;the encouragements held out to the farmer,
suffers no diminution. Indeed, there are great inducements for the
<i>industrious</i> to migrate hither. Though the soil is uneven, it is
far from being sterile; and exclusive of salubrity of situation, and
of durable timber for fences, the coal mines, which pervade almost
every hill, constitute treasures of great value.

"We remark much difference between the manners of the inhabitants of
this country and those of Cayuga. In that place, profane language is
rarely heard from any person, who pretends to decency, except in a
paroxysm of vexation. Here it is an every day amusement. Crossing the
Monongahela, in the ferry-boat, with an intelligent gentleman of
polished manners, I was shocked and surprised to hear almost every
sentence from his lips interlarded with an oath or an imprecation; yet
he was in gay good humour, and, I believe, unconscious of this breach
of decorum.
</p>

<p>
It would be unjust not to express my belief, that honourable
exceptions to these censures are numerous; but impiety certainly
constitutes a strong characteristic of no inconsiderable part of this
people&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
I have remarked with regret the impiety of some of these citizens; but
we think, that generally, they are entitled to much praise for
obliging and courteous behaviour. Civility to strangers, in a high
degree, even pervades their factories; and in all those which I have

spectators for money, appears to be unknown." <cite>Thomas's Travels

"Except the gratifying reflection arising from the review of so much
plastic industry, Pittsburg is by no means a pleasant city to a
stranger. The constant volumes of smoke preserve the atmosphere in a
continued cloud of coal dust. In October, 1815, by a reduced
calculation, at least 2000 bushels of that fuel was consumed daily, on
a space of about two and a quarter square miles. To this is added a
scene of activity, that reminds the spectator that he is within a
commercial port, though 300 miles from the sea.

Several good inns, and many good taverns, are scattered over the city;

reason, that strangers are usually disappointed on visiting it. This,

American gasconade. When I am told that at a particular hotel there is
<i>handsome</i> accommodation, I expect that they are one remove from
very bad; if '<i>elegant</i> entertainment,' I anticipate tolerable;
if a person is 'a <i>clever</i> man,' that he is not absolutely a
fool; and if a manufactory is the '<i>first in the world</i>,' I
expect, and have generally found, about six men and three boys
employed." <cite>Fearon's Sketches of America, 1818.</cite>

"As every blessing has its attendant evil, the stone coal is
productive of considerable inconvenience from the smoke which
overhangs the town, and descends in fine dust which blackens every
object; even snow can scarcely be called white in Pittsburgh. The
persons and dress of the inhabitants, in the interior of the houses as
well as the exterior, experience its effect. The tall steeple of the
court house, was once painted white, but alas! how changed. Yet all
this might be prevented by some additional expense on the construction
of the chimnies. In the English manufacturing towns, a fine is imposed
upon those who do not consume their smoke. Incalculable would be the
advantage to this place, could such a regulation be adopted."

a very important town; and have no doubt, although its prosperity is
now at a stand, and property if not declining, is not increasing in
value, that it will <i>gradually advance</i>; and that the time must
come when it will be an extensive and very populous city. The present
population is 10,000, made up from all nations, and, of course, not
free from the vices of each: this indeed is but too apparent upon a
very short residence." <cite>Fearon's Sketches of America,

tool factory, Cowan's New Rolling Mill, a new lock factory built by
Patterson, two steam engine and boiler works, one steel factory and a
goodly number of small concerns manufacturing various articles. In
1817 the city councils appointed a committee to collect and publish a
list of all the large factories in the city. This was done perhaps to
let the world know of the industry and thrift of Pittsburg, and is
valuable because it is an official list and is to be relied upon. It
must also be remembered that these figures represented the industries

"The first rope-walk erected west of the Allegheny Mountains, was
established in Pittsburgh in 1794, and was located on the ground now
occupied by the Monongahela House. The business was carried on by Col.
John Irwin and wife&#8230;.

<p>
Immediately following the death of Col. Irwin, Mrs. Irwin gave her son
an interest in the business; and it was carried on under the name and
style of Mary and John Irwin.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1795 the works were removed to the square bounded by
Liberty, Third, and Fourth Streets and Redoubt Alley. In view of the
increasing demand for their products, and confined limits of this
locality, the walk was removed in 1812 to the bank of the Allegheny
River between Marbury Street and the point, where the entire rigging
for Perry's fleet was manufactured&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Irwin, on account of her age, and loss of health, resolved to
quit business, in view of which she disposed of her interest to her
son, who, in accordance with his preconceived notions on the subject,
commenced the erection, in Allegheny, in 1813, of one of the most
extensive works in the West, on the ten-acre out-lot bounded by the
West Commons, Water Lane (now Western Avenue), out-lots Nos. 275, 29,
and 30. It was known and designated as out-lot No. 276 in the 'Reserve
Tract opposite Pittsburg.' Mr. Irwin successfully carried on the
business until Jan. 1, 1835, when he associated with him his son
Henry, under the name of John Irwin &#38; Son." <cite>Parke's

"Before the time of railroads between the east and west of the
Allegheny mountains, the freight business to the Monongahela was
carried on by means of the Conestoga road wagons drawn by six horses.
By this way the freight to Pittsburgh was carried exclusively, but
after the completion of the Pennsylvania canal, transportation was
divided between the canal-boat and the wagon. As early as 1817 12,000
wagons, in twelve months, passed over the Allegheny mountains from
Philadelphia and Baltimore, each with from four to six horses,
carrying from thirty-five to forty hundred weight. The cost was about
$7 per 100 weight, in some cases $10. To transport one ton of freight
between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, therefore, would cost about $140,
and in so doing two weeks, at least, of time would be consumed."

"The standard wagon for heavy work was the 'Conestoga.' The bed was
low in the center and high at each end. The lower part of the bed was
painted blue. Above this was a red part about a foot wide which could
be taken off when necessary, and these with the white canvas covering,
made the patriotic tri-color of the American flag, though this was
probably unintentional. Bells were often used in all seasons of the
year though not strings of bells such as were afterwards used in
sleighing. The wagoner's bells were fastened to an iron bow above the
hames on the horses and were pear shaped and very sweet toned. Perhaps
they relieved the monotony of the long journey over the lonely pike."

"There was almost a continuous stream of four or six horse wagons
laden with merchandise, going west and returning with the product of
the Ohio Valley to supply the eastern cities. These wagons journeyed
mostly between Pittsburg and Philadelphia and Baltimore. The wagoners
generally stopped at a wayside inn which was less expensive than at
the inns in the villages. Wagoners cared little for style but demanded
an abundance while the stage-coach passengers demanded both. The
wagoner invariably slept on a bunk which he carried with him and which
he laid on the floor of the big bar-room and office of the country
hotel. Stage drivers and their passengers stopped at the best hotels
and paid higher prices. For the purpose of feeding his horses in the
public square, the wagoner carried a long trough which at night he
fastened with special irons to the tongue of the wagon&#8230;. An old
gentleman told the writer that he had once seen 52 wagons in an
unbroken line going towards Pittsburg on this pike. They were
Conestoga wagons with great bowed beds covered with canvas, and none
of them were drawn by less than four, while many of them had six
horses. The old fashioned public square which kept them over night
must have been a good sized one. The public squares on this turnpike
were usually from three to four hundred feet long and from two to
three hundred feet wide. Some of the older villages had two squares
separated a short distance from each other, but this was generally
brought about by a rivalry among two factions when the town was first
laid out." <cite>Boucher's Century and a half of Pittsburg.</cite>

"When a village was laid out along the pike there was usually a public

were set apart for taverns. This square generally called a diamond,
was not intended as a place of ornament as it usually is now, but was
for special purposes. There the wagons laden with freight stood over
night, and as a general rule in all kinds of weather, the horses were
blanketed, fed and bedded in the public square. Upon these wagons were
transported nearly all the goods between Philadelphia and Pittsburg."

"Pittsburg is a cheap market for horses &#8230; travellers from the east,
often quit their horses here, and take the river for New Orleans, &#38;c.;
and on the contrary, those from the west proceed eastward from this
place, in stages. Thus, there are constantly a number of useful
hackneys on sale. The mode of selling is by auction. The auctioneer
rides the animal through the streets, proclaiming with a loud voice,
the biddings that are made as he passes along, and when they reach the
desired point, or when nobody bids more, he closes the bargain.

"A requisite of the old-fashioned wagon or stage town hotel or of the
wayside inn was a large room used as an office and bar-room and as a
sleeping place for the wagoners. In it was a large open fireplace
which was abundantly supplied with wood in the early days, and later
with coal. Around this, when the horses were cared for and the
evening's diversion was over, the wagoners spread their bunks in a
sort of semi-circle with their feet to the fire, for they were said to
be much subjected to rheumatism, and this position was taken as a
preventative&#8230;. Wagoners drove in all kinds of weather and the
descent of a mountain or large hill was often attended with great
danger, especially when it was covered with ice. The day's journey of
a regular wagoner when heavily laden, was rather less than over 20
miles, and 100 miles in a week was a fair average&#8230;. The average load
hauled was about 6,000 pounds for a six horse team. Sometimes four
tons were put on, and even five tons which the wagoner boastfully
called 'a hundred hundred,' were hauled, but these were rare
exceptions." <cite>Boucher's Century and a half of Pittsburg.</cite>

"Many travellers and emigrants to this region, view the first samples
of the mode of travelling in the western world, on the Allegany at
Oleanne point, or the Monongahela at Brownsville. These are but the
retail specimens. At Pittsburg, where these rivers unite, you have the
thing in gross, and by wholesale. The first thing that strikes a
stranger from the Atlantic, arrived at the boat-landing, is the
singular, whimsical, and amusing spectacle, of the varieties of
water-craft, of all shapes and structures. There is the stately barge,
of the size of a large Atlantic schooner, with its raised and
outlandish looking deck&#8230;. Next there is the keel-boat, of a long,
slender, and elegant form, and generally carrying from fifteen to
thirty tons&#8230;. Next in order are the Kentucky flats, or in the
vernacular phrase, 'broad-horns,' a species of ark, very nearly
resembling a New England pig-stye. They are fifteen feet wide, and
from forty to one hundred feet in length, and carry from twenty to
seventy tons. Some of them, that are called family-boats, and used by
families in descending the river, are very large and roomy, and have
comfortable and separate apartments, fitted up with chairs, beds,
tables and stoves. It is no uncommon spectacle to see a large family,
old and young, servants, cattle, hogs, horses, sheep, fowls, and
animals of all kinds, bringing to recollection the cargo of the
ancient ark, all embarked, and floating down on the same bottom. Then
there are what the people call 'covered sleds,' or ferry-flats, and
Allegany-skiffs, carrying from eight to twelve tons. In another place
are pirogues of from two to four tons burthen, hollowed sometimes from
one prodigious tree, or from the trunks of two trees united, and a
plank rim fitted to the upper part. There are common skiffs, and other
small craft, named, from the manner of making them, 'dug-outs,' and
canoes hollowed from smaller trees&#8230;. You can scarcely imagine an
abstract form in which a boat can be built, that in some part of the
Ohio or Mississippi you will not see, actually in motion&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
This variety of boats, so singular in form, and most of them
apparently so frail, is destined in many instances to voyages of from
twelve hundred to three thousand miles." <cite>Flint's Recollections

"I reached Olean, on the source of the Alleghany River, early in 1818,
while the snow was yet upon the ground, and had to wait several weeks
for the opening of that stream. I was surprised to see the crowd of
persons, from various quarters, who had pressed to this point, waiting
for the opening of the navigation.
</p>

<p>
It was a period of general migration from the East to the West.
Commerce had been checked for several years by the war with Great
Britain. Agriculture had been hindered by the raising of armies, and a
harassing warfare both on the sea-board and the frontiers; and
manufactures had been stimulated to an unnatural growth, only to be
crushed by the peace. Speculation had also been rife in some places,
and hurried many gentlemen of property into ruin. Banks exploded, and
paper money flooded the country.
</p>

<p>
The fiscal crisis was indeed very striking. The very elements seemed
leagued against the interests of agriculture in the Atlantic States,
where a series of early and late frosts, in 1816 and 1817, had created
quite a panic, which helped to settle the West.
</p>

<p>
I mingled in this crowd, and, while listening to the anticipations
indulged in, it seemed to me that the war had not, in reality, been
fought for 'free trade and sailors' rights' where it commenced, but to
gain a knowledge of the world beyond the Alleghanies.
</p>

<p>
Many came with their household stuff, which was to be embarked in arks
and flat boats. The children of Israel could scarcely have presented a
more motley array of men and women, with their 'kneading troughs' on
their backs, and their 'little ones,' than were there assembled, on
their way to the new land of promise.
</p>

<p>
To judge by the tone of general conversation, they meant, in their
generation, to plough the Mississippi Valley from its head to its
foot. There was not an idea short of it. What a world of golden dreams
was there!
</p>

<p>
I took passage on the first ark that attempted the descent for the
season. This ark was built of stout planks, with the lower seams
caulked, forming a perfectly flat basis on the water. It was about
thirty feet wide and sixty long, with gunwales of some eighteen
inches. Upon this was raised a structure of posts and boards about
eight feet high, divided into rooms for cooking and sleeping, leaving
a few feet space in front and rear, to row and steer. The whole was
covered by a flat roof, which formed a promenade, and near the front
part of this deck were two long 'sweeps,' a species of gigantic oars,
which were occasionally resorted to in order to keep the unwieldy
vessel from running against islands or dangerous shores.
</p>

<p>
We went on swimmingly, passing through the Seneca reservation, where
the picturesque costume of the Indians seen on shore served to give
additional interest to scenes of the deepest and wildest character.
Every night we tied our ark to a tree, and built a fire on shore.
Sometimes we narrowly escaped going over falls, and once encountered a
world of labor and trouble by getting into a wrong channel. I made
myself as useful and agreeable as possible to all. I had learned to
row a skiff with dexterity during my residence on Lake Dunmore, and
turned this art to account by taking the ladies ashore, as we floated
on with our ark, and picked up specimens while they culled shrubs and
flowers. In this way, and by lending a ready hand at the 'sweeps' and
at the oars whenever there was a pinch, I made myself agreeable. The
worst thing we encountered was rain, against which our rude carpentry
was but a poor defence. We landed at everything like a town, and
bought milk, and eggs, and butter. Sometimes the Seneca Indians were
passed, coming up stream in their immensely long pine canoes. There
was perpetual novelty and freshness in this mode of wayfaring. The
scenery was most enchanting. The river ran high, with a strong spring
current, and the hills frequently rose in most picturesque cliffs.
</p>

<p>
1818. I do not recollect the time consumed in this descent. We had
gone about three hundred miles, when we reached Pittsburgh. It was the
28th of March when we landed at this place, which I remember because
it was my birthday. And I here bid adieu to the kind and excellent
proprietor of the ark, L. Pettiborne, Esq., who refused to receive any
compensation for my passage, saying, prettily, that he did not know
how they could have got along without me.
</p>

<p>
I stopped at one of the best hotels, kept by a Mrs. McCullough, and,
after visiting the manufactories and coal mines, hired a horse, and
went up the Monongahela Valley, to explore its geology as high as
Williamsport. The rich coal and iron beds of this part of the country
interested me greatly; I was impressed with their extent, and value,
and the importance which they must eventually give to Pittsburgh.
After returning from this trip, I completed my visits to the various
work-shops and foundries, and to the large glass-works of Bakewell and
of O'Hara.
</p>

<p>
I was now at the head of the Ohio River, which is formed by the
junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela. My next step was to descend
this stream; and, while in search of an ark on the borders of the
Monongahela, I fell in with a Mr. Brigham, a worthy person from
Massachusetts, who had sallied out with the same view. We took passage
together on one of these floating houses, with the arrangements of
which I had now become familiar. I was charmed with the Ohio; with its
scenery, which was every moment shifting to the eye; and with the
incidents of such a novel voyage." <cite>Schoolcraft's Thirty years

Pennsylvania, 'Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,' said he, 'there is no such

shall detain your papers and ship till we see farther into this.' The
American captain tried for some time, in vain, to convince him; till

"The best mode perhaps in descending the Ohio, in time of low water,
is in keel boats&#8230;. Merchants are beginning to prefer this method for
safety and expedition; and instead of purchasing boats and taking
charge of them themselves, they get their goods freighted down from

their business to be prepared, with good boats and experienced hands
for such engagements." <cite>Cramer's Navigator, 1817.</cite>

"The manners of the boatmen are as strange as their language. Their
peculiar way of life has given origin not only to an appropriate
dialect, but to new modes of enjoyment, riot, and fighting. Almost
every boat, while it lies in the harbour has one or more fiddles
scraping continually aboard, to which you often see the boatmen
dancing. There is no wonder that the way of life which the boatmen
lead, in turn extremely indolent, and extremely laborious; for days
together requiring little or no effort, and attended with no danger,
and then on a sudden, laborious and hazardous, beyond Atlantic
navigation; generally plentiful as it respects food, and always so as
it regards whiskey, should always have seductions that prove
irresistible to the young people that live near the banks of the
river&#8230;. And yet with all these seductions for the eye and the
imagination, no life is so slavish, none so precarious and dangerous.
In no employment do the hands so wear out. After the lapse of so very
short a period since these waters have been navigated in this way, at
every bend, and every high point of the river, you are almost sure to
see, as you stop for a moment, indications of the 'narrow house;' the
rude monument, the coarse memorial, carved on an adjoining tree by a
brother boatman, which marks that an exhausted boatman there yielded
his breath, and was buried." <cite>Flint's Recollections of the last

"Three steamers were built at Pittsburgh in 1816, the 'Franklin,' one
hundred and twenty-five tons, by Messrs. Shiras and Cromwell; the
'Oliver Evans,' seventy-five tons, by George Evans; and the 'Harriet,'
forty tons, by a Mr. Armstrong of Williamsport, Pennsylvania&#8230;. Up to
1816 grave doubts existed as to the practicability of navigating the
Ohio by steamboats. A gentleman who in that year, with others, long
watched the futile efforts of a stern wheeler to ascend the Horsetail
ripple, five miles below Pittsburgh, afterwards wrote that the
unanimous conclusion of the company was that 'such a contrivance might
do for the Mississippi &#8230; but that we of Ohio must wait for some more
happy century of invention.'" <cite>Magazine of western history,

"On the 30th December, the steamboat Oliver Evans, departed from this

less than ever known&#8230;. Her length is one hundred and twenty feet and
beam fourteen feet nine inches. She ascended the Allegheny when it was
high and rapid, at the rate of five miles per hour, and passed over
the ripple at Wainright's island, at such a rate as to cause people on

"Between 1764 and 1819 the only means of crossing these streams, at
Pittsburg, was by way of ferries. The first of these, it is believed,
was operated from the foot of Ferry street, Pittsburg to the opposite
shore, and this was the origin of the name 'Ferry street'&#8230;. Early in
the nineteenth century a ferry was established from the mouth of
Liberty street, called 'Jones Ferry.' Foot passengers desiring to
cross the river employed skiffs, while stock was taken over on
flat-boats. Such boats were pushed by means of poles, at low stages of
water, and by oars in high water periods." <cite>Boucher's Century and

"'The Pittsburgh Gazette' under the original proprietor, Mr. John
Scull, was the first establishment of the kind, west of the mountains.
On its first appearance, it was viewed as a meteor of the moment,
whose existence would terminate with the second or third number; and
the idea of deriving a subsistence from its publication, was classed
among the chimeras of a too sanguine temper. Our country was then a
'howling wilderness,' and the Ohio, whose fair bosom is now covered
with the 'white sails of commerce,' was then disturbed only by the
yell of the savage, who lay ambushed on its bank, or glided over its
surface, in his solitary canoe. But these obstacles, though
disheartening, were not sufficient to destroy the enterprize of the
Editor. He had turned his back on civilization and comforts of his
native place; he had deliberately subjected himself to the
inconveniences of emigration, and his was not the ardour to be damped
at the outset&#8230;. He became a citizen of Pittsburgh, when it was
little more than an Indian village; his interests grew with its
growth; he saw it rise into a manufacturing town; he has heard it
emphatically called the 'Birmingham of America;' and finally, he has
the triumphant satisfaction, of beholding in his own days, the village
of the desert, changed into the city of the west. He has succeeded
even beyond his expectations; he has run his moderate, unostentatious
course. The patronage he has received, was sufficient for his desires;
his editorial life here ends; with feelings acutely sensible of the
favors he has received, he now relinquishes to his son and successor
the 'Pittsburgh Gazette,' unstained by corruption, and free from
venality, but ever firm, he trusts, in supporting our palladium, the

"The kind of news material found in the columns of papers of those
days is entirely different from the style of material found today.
Local news is rarely ever given in the papers of an early day. As a
rule the subscriber read but one paper and local news could be handed
around by gossip from one neighbor to another, and what the subscriber
demanded in his paper was foreign news that he could gain in no other
way. The founding of new enterprises, marriages, or deaths of
prominent citizens, etc. found no place in the pioneer newspaper.
European news necessarily nearly two months old, long articles on the
management of public affairs, controversies carried on from week to
week between rival exponents on different theories, essays on morality
and amateur poetry, fill up the columns of nearly all the early
newspapers of Western Pennsylvania&#8230;. Their value to those who would

Pittsburgh, at this time under the care of the Rev. Samuel Barr,'
which, after much delay, was finally passed on the twenty-ninth of
September, 1787. The Penns gave the site for this church&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
In the Spring of 1811 Reverend Francis Herron became the pastor of the
First Church, which the year before had had a membership of
sixty-five. Dr. Herron's salary was six hundred dollars per annum. For
thirty-nine years he labored ceaselessly and wisely for the church and

services in the First Church, were unsatisfactory. The next year Dr.
Nathaniel Snowden took charge of the congregation which worshiped &#8230;
in the Court House and other places, public and private. Dr. John
Boggs came, but remained only a short time. He was replaced by the

"Mr. Jacob Negley, whose wife had been a Miss Winebiddle, and

is now known as East Liberty Valley, in the early days, called
Negleystown. He was largely instrumental &#8230; in erecting a small frame
school building at what subsequently became the corner of Penn and
South Highland avenues. This was for the accommodation of the children
of the district, as well as his own. It was &#8230; a long distance to the
then established churches, and Mr. Negley very often, for the benefit
of the neighborhood, invited some minister passing through, or one
from one of the other churches, to preach in his own house and later
in the school house. In 1819 the little school house was torn down to
make way for a church building." <cite>Killikelly's History of

Black, an Irishman of considerable intellectual force, who had been
graduated from the University of Glasgow, was its first pastor&#8230;. He

Roman Catholic Church

"The number of Catholics prior to 1800, in what is now Allegheny

missionaries traveling westward&#8230;. [These] priests, ministering to a
few scattered families, celebrating Mass in private houses, fill up
the long interval between the chapel of the 'Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin of the Beautiful River' in Fort Duquesne, and 'Old St.
Patrick's Church,' which was begun in 1808.
</p>

<p>
Rev. Wm. F. X. O'Brien, the first pastor, was ordained in Baltimore,
1808, and came to Pittsburg in November of the same year, and at once
devoted himself to the erection of &#8230; 'Old St. Patrick's.' It stood
at the corner of Liberty and Washington streets, at the head of
Eleventh street, in front of the new Union Station&#8230;. The structure
was of brick, plain in design and modest in size, about fifty feet in
length and thirty in width. Rt. Rev. Michael Egan dedicated the Church
in August 1811, and the dedication was the occasion of the first visit
of a Bishop to this part of the State." <cite>St. Paul's Cathedral

<p>
"The building of the first Trinity Church was begun about the time it
was organized and chartered, 1805. It occupied a triangular lot at the
corner of Sixth, Wood and Liberty streets. It was built in an oval
form that it might more nearly conform to the shape of the three
cornered lot and for this reason was generally known as the 'round
church.' Rev. Taylor in his latter years became known as 'Father'
Taylor. He remained with the church as its rector until 1817, when he

"When John Penn, jr., and John Penn presented land to the Presbyterian
and Episcopal churches of Pittsburgh they, at the same time, deeded
the same amount to the already organized German Evangelical
congregation; the land given to them was bounded by Smithfield street,
Sixth avenue, Miltenberger and Strawberry alleys. No church was built
on this grant, however, until some time between 1791-94, and it was of
logs. This was &#8230; replaced in 1833 by a large brick building, which
had the distinction of a cupola, in which the first church bell in
Pittsburgh was hung." <cite>Killikelly's History of Pittsburgh.</cite>

<p class="ctrtoppad">
Methodist Episcopal Church
</p>

<p>
"In June, 1810, a lot was purchased for the first [Methodist] church
built in the city. It was situated on Front street, now First street,
nearly opposite &#8230; the present Monongahela House. The erection of a
church was commenced at once, for on August 26th of that year Bishop
Asbury preached on the foundation of it. His journal says: 'Preached
on the foundation of the new chapel to about five hundred souls. I
spoke again at 5 o'clock to about twice as many. The society here is
lively and increasing in numbers.' The building was a plain brick
structure, 30 &#215; 40 feet. We do not know certainly when it was
completed, but probably in the autumn of 1810.
</p>

<p>
In this church the society continued to worship in peace and
prosperity for eight years. But near the close of this period it had
become too small, and a new and larger one became a necessity.
Consequently, in May, 1817, three lots were purchased on the corner of
Smithfield and Seventh streets, and the erection of a larger church
commenced. It was completed the following year." <cite>Warner's

independent organization and included about six families with perhaps
not more than twelve people in all who had come from New England. The
chief organizer and pastor was Rev. Edward Jones, also from New
England. The society was too poor then to build a church, but
worshiped in private houses and in rented halls." <cite>Boucher's

Schools
</h2>


<p>
"Robert Steele, who afterward became a Presbyterian preacher, opened a
school in Pittsburg in January, 1803, at his house on Second
street&#8230;. His rates were four dollars per quarter. In 1803, a teacher
named Carr opened a school for both boys and girls. The next year he
advertised that his school was moved to larger quarters over Dubac's
store, where he probably taught till 1808, when he opened a boarding
school for boys. In 1818 he removed his school to Third street where
Mrs. Carr 'instructed young ladies in a separate room in the usual
branches, and in all kinds of needle work.' William Jones began a
school in 1804, and charged but two dollars per quarter for tuition.
In February, 1808, Samuel Kingston opened a school in a stone house on
Second street&#8230;. A teacher named Graham opened a school on Second
street, using the room formerly occupied by Mr. Kingston, in which he
proposed to give his pupils an English and classical education on
moderate terms. The advertisement stated that Mrs. Graham would at the
same time open a school for 'young ladies' in an adjoining room, and
that she would instruct them in all branches of an English education
and in needle work. In 1811 Thomas Hunt opened a school 'for the
instruction of females exclusively.' The hours he advertised were from
8 to 12 a.m., and from 2 to 5 p.m&#8230;. In the same year this
advertisement appears: 'Messrs. Chute and Noyes' evening school
commences the first of October next. They also propose on Sabbath
morning, the 22 instant, to open a Sunday morning school to commence
at the hour of eight a.m., and continue until ten. They propose to
divide the males and females into separate departments. The design of
the school is to instruct those who wish to attend, the Catechism and
hear them read the Holy Scriptures. No pecuniary compensation is
desired, a consciousness of doing good will be an ample reward.' In
1812 John Brevost opened a French school, and with his wife and
daughter opened a boarding school in connection with it in 1814. Their
terms were, 'for reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar,
history and geography, with the use of maps, globes, etc., $8.00
quarterly. Playing on the piano, $10.00 quarterly; vocal music, $5.00
quarterly. Drawing and painting of flowers, $6.00 quarterly. French
language, $5.00 quarterly. Boarding $37.00, payable in advance.
Dancing, books, materials, drawing, sewing, bed and bedding to be paid
for separately or furnished by parents.' Mrs. Gazzam had opened a
seminary for young ladies by this time, and advertised its removal to
Fifth street. Her pupils were instructed in the elementary studies of
an English education, and in needle work at four dollars per quarter.
She taught them to cut, make and repair their clothes. The pupils were
permitted to visit their homes once each week, but no young men were
allowed to visit them unless attended by a servant. She boarded them
for $125 per year. The two sisters, Miss Anna and Arabella Watts,
instructed young ladies solely in needle work. In almost all schools
needle work was a requisite part of the education of young women. In
fact it was considered the all important part of a woman's training
and not infrequently other branches were taught if required, or if
thought necessary." <cite>Boucher's Century and a half of

The principals of the academy from the very beginning were men of high

the first principal, took office April 13, 1789. Rev. Robert Steele,
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Rev. John Taylor, Mr. Hopkins
and James Mountain successively were at the head of the academy. From
1807 to 1810, Rev. Robert Patterson, of excellent fame, successfully
carried on the work. He was succeeded in the latter year by Rev.
Joseph Stockton, author of the 'Western Calculator' and 'Western
Spelling Book,' who continued in office until the re-incorporation of
the academy as the Western University of Pennsylvania, in 1819."

<p>
"It was not &#8230; until the fall of 1813, that the question of a
community Library took definite shape, when in response to the efforts
'of many leading and progressive citizens,' there was organized 'The
Pittsburgh Library Company.' On the evening of November 27, 1813,
about 40 representative people assembled in the spacious 'bar room' of
the 'Green Tree Inn,' at the northwest corner of Fifth and Wood
streets, where the First National Bank now stands, and took the
initiative in the formation of Pittsburgh's first real public
library&#8230;. Its first president was the Rev. Francis Herron, for 40
years pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. The secretary was
Aquila M. Bolton, 'land broker and conveyancer.' The treasurer was
Col. John Spear&#8230;. Quite a sum of money was subscribed by citizens
generally for the purchase of books, while many valuable volumes were
either contributed or loaned by members. Messrs. Baldwin, O'Hara,
Wilkins and Forward being especially mentioned for their generosity in
this connection. The first head-quarters of the library were in rooms
'on Second street, opposite Squire Robert Graham's office,' who at
that time dispensed even handed justice at the northeast corner of
Market and Second streets. Here the library remained until the county
commissioners set aside a commodious room in the Court House for its
use." <cite>A. L. Hardy, in Gazette-Times, 1913.</cite>

December thirtieth, 1816. The following gentlemen were then elected by
ballot to serve as a Board of Directors for the ensuing three years,

The Theatre
</h2>


<p>
"There were in 1808 two dramatic societies in Pittsburg that were
important enough to receive notice in the newspapers. The one was
composed of law students and young lawyers and the other was composed
of mechanics. The object of these societies was to study the poets and
dramatic literature and to give public performances in the court
house. William Wilkins &#8230; was a member and took a leading part in the
entertainments given by these societies. There was no way for
theatrical companies from the East to reach Pittsburg prior to 1817,
save by the state road, which was scarcely passable for a train of
pack horses, yet they came even as early as 1808 and performed in a
small room, which was secured for them when the court room was
occupied. In 1812 a third dramatic society called the Thespian Society
was organized among the young men and young women of Pittsburg.
</p>

<p>
The society numbered among its members the brightest and best bred
young people of the city, most of whom took part in each performance.
They were given in a room on Wood street, in a building known as
Masonic Hall." <cite>Boucher's Century and a half of Pittsburg.</cite>

"The Theatre of this City has been now opened nearly a fortnight, and
the managers although they have used every exertion to please, in the

expenses of the House. This is a severe satire on the taste of the
place.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow [Wednesday] evening we understand that the 'Stranger' is to
be produced&#8212;we hope under auspices more favorable to the managers

Boards.&#8212;If report speaks correctly of his talents, he bids fair to
excel any person who has yet appeared upon the stage on this side the
Mountains. It is hoped that this novelty, together with the correct
and manly acting of Mr. Savage, a stranger here, and the chastened
elegance which Mrs. Savage is said to exhibit, will attract to the
Theatre, for this one evening at least, the friends to this rational
amusement." <cite>Commonwealth, Nov. 12, 1816.</cite>

"A few days after the performance of Hamlet, Mr. Entwistle, the
manager, had for his benefit, that irresistibly amusing burlesque,
'Hamlet Travestie.' His line of acting is a broad-farce caricature of
that of Liston. He personated the modern Danish prince. The audience
were solemn, serious, and dull. The affecting entrance of the deranged
Ophelia, who, instead of rosemary, rue, &#38;c. had an ample supply of
turnips and carrots, did not move a muscle of their <i>intelligent
faces</i>&#8212;the ladies, indeed, excepted, who evinced by the frequent
use of their pocket handkerchiefs, that their sympathies were engaged
on the side of the love-sick maiden. Some who had seen the original
Hamlet for the first time a few evenings before, gave vent to their
criticisms when the curtain fell. They thought Mr. Entwistle did not
look sufficiently grave; and that, as it was his benefit, he acted
very dishonourably in shaving (cheating) them out of two acts; for
that they guessed when Mr. Hutton played <i>that'ere</i> king's mad
son, he gave them five acts for their <i>dallar</i>. Mr. &#8212;&#8212; assured
me that on the following morning, a respectable lawyer of Pittsburgh
met him, and said, 'I was at the play last night, Sir, and do not
think that Mr. Entwistle acted Hamlet quite so well as Mr. Hutton.'"

act limited the city taxation to five mills on a dollar, and the
corporation could scarcely have paid a police force, even if one had
been required. The city authorities did, however, pass an ordinance on
August 24, 1816, establishing a night watchman, but soon found they
had no money with which to pay him. They accordingly repealed the
ordinance and for some years the city slept in darkness without the
benefit of police protection." <cite>Boucher's Century and a half of

Eagle Fire Company
</h2>


<p>
"In 1811 the second epoch in the company's history may be said to have
started, the younger element having gradually crept in and assumed
control of affairs, and the older men had to some extent lost interest
and perhaps gained rheumatism in the fire service. The company was now
re-organized on a more active and vigorous basis. The first engineer
to take charge under the new regime was William Eichbaum, who
continued to act in that capacity until 1832, when he was elected
First Chief Engineer of the Fire Department on its organization&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
In the company organization the most important duty devolved upon the
Bucket Committee. Every citizen was required to keep two or three
heavy leather buckets with his name painted on them, and in case of
fire these were all brought on the ground. Two lines of men and women
were formed to the water supply, to pass the full buckets to and the
empty ones from the engine&#8230;. When the fire was extinguished all the
buckets were left on the ground till next day. Then, as many of the
inscriptions were obliterated, there was some stealing of buckets and
consequent fights. Certain folks &#8230; picked out the best buckets, just
as in modern times some people get the best hats, or umbrellas, at the
conclusion of a party. The Bucket Committee, to put a stop to this,
decided to deliver all buckets to their respective owners."

making of four wells, not less than forty-seven feet in depth. Three
of these were to be located on Market street, and were to be walled

"At the beginning of the century the site of Allegheny City was a

following words: 'An indigent and needy neighborhood, situated on the
Allegheny, opposite Pittsburgh, having applied for supplies,' the
matter was laid before the Presbytery.

"There is always a peculiar solemnity which impresses every thoughtful
mind on the birthday of another Year. The year one thousand eight
hundred and sixteen, with all its cares, with all its bustle, its
pleasures and its pains, has gone, and now mingles with the departed
dreams of our midnight slumbers. How many of us imagined while engaged
in the din and bustle and uproar of the world, that this era would
form an important epoch in the history of man? and yet all these
thoughts have now vanished, and scarce left a record on the pages of
memory behind!" <cite>Gazette, Jan. 14, 1817.</cite>
